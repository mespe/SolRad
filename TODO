##TO DO (Task) list:

2 Feb 2017
---------

Short Term:
	  - Code review on Rcimis package: Test package, review code, add documentation where need. If you find a major issue, create bug report on the github page.
	  - Review existing work, fill in documentation, ask questions for parts that are not clear.
	  - Start simple: Get solar radiation data for a single weather station (Colusa), state average yields, and air quality data for the Sacramento Valley Air basin. Start to investigate the data.

Long Term:
	 - Figure out how to reconstruct the season timing data
	 - Think about how to combine data from multiple levels - how do we map daily data from a single point to a single yield number for a county.

---------

Short Term:

	- Get crop data from USDA API
	  - There is existing code on github that might need to be modified to work.
	  - Focus on CA rice, from 1992 - 2016

	- Investigate DVD data
	  - Read the README file to see what is available
	  - Flag the most promising parameters
	  - (Data available on Duncan's server - see slack channel for link)

	- Pull solar radiation/weather data from CIMIS API
	  - Pull just a single station at first (Colusa)
	  -

Long Term:

	 - Explore above data (once collected) look for missing data, patterns, possible new areas of exploration.
	 - Conduct quality checks on the data.
	 - Code review. Make sure code from above steps is
	   1. Clear
	   2. Consistent
	   3. Robust

----------

  - Determine what data we need:
  	- See outline - Add more if you see anything missing

  - Where do those data live?
  	- Crop (USDA)
	- Solar radiation (NASA POWER, CIMIS, maybe PGE?)
	- Air Quality (CA Air Resource Board, weater.com?)
	- Covariates: climate, etc?

  - sign up for slack
  - Send Matt github usenames
  - Think about how to organize this
  	- How should we share data?
