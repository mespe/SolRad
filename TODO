##TO DO (Task) list:

9 Mar
-------

Solar radiation:
 - Explore variability in solar radiation, specifically separate
 before atmo. and on ground. Goal is to separate into natural vs.
 unnatural variation. [Luman, Gulzina, Zamir]

Yield vs. Solar radiation:
 - Put data together. right now using 50% planting/harvesting date,
 state average yields, average solar radiation (sum) [Scott?]
 - Alternate analysis: Use full data from planting progress [Henry, Matt, Melissa]

2 Mar
--------

CARB:
 - See if trends are similar between PM2.5 and PM10 [MATT]
 - Ask about the MERRA-Aero dataset [MATT]

Solar radiation [Zamir, Gulzina, Luman, ...]
 - compare to clear sky
 - compare to other stations

Yield: [Henry, Scott]
 - combine with solar radiation data
 - explore ways to fill in missing values
 - begin to explore data


 

FEb 23
---------

CARB data:

MATT: Pull additional CIMIS data, put up on server.
 - Get start and end dates (Check Henry's script, should work)
 - Pull down state average yield

Start with simple average/sum - look at this

Get Matt names/contact info for credit

Group:

 - Investigate the impact/influence of missingness in the CARB data. Matt will send out an email for times to meet next week.

15 Feb
--------

- Need meta-data for each of the datasets: Currently this is in many different places, and it is easy to become confused about where data are coming from.

- Coverage for air quality: spatial and temporial. We need to figure out if there is enough data here to answer our question. If not, we need a different source of info. Look at: How many stations are there in the Sacramento Valley? How many of them have records? How often are data recorded?

- CFSR: Need to better understand why and how this is differing with on the ground measurements. Is it off by a constant scale, or does it vary over time. Does adding additional variables help with predictions? Is it worth losing 2010-present?

- Need to get yield and CIMIS data on same scale (spatial and temporal) so we can begin to compare them.

- Cleaning and error checking in on-going


9 Feb 2017
---------

Cleaning and exploring:

- Get the USDA into useful format: Converting char to numeric, cleaning, possibly dropping extra cols. (Henry, possibly Melissa)
- Alter script to clean CIMIS data: (Luman)

- get CARB metadata in secondary table. (Zamir, Gulzina, XingYi)

CFSR:
- Get a comparison to observed data (Luman)
- compare to air pollution, see if there is a relationship (Luman)

CARB:
- Target pollutants: PM2.5/PM10, Ozone, NOx, SO2, H2S (Zamir, Gulzina, XingYi)
  -Ozone completed
  



2 Feb 2017
---------

Short Term:
	  - Code review on Rcimis package: Test package, review code, add documentation where need. If you find a major issue, create bug report on the github page.
	  - Review existing work, fill in documentation, ask questions for parts that are not clear.
	  - Start simple: Get solar radiation data for a single weather station (Colusa), state average yields, and air quality data for the Sacramento Valley Air basin. Start to investigate the data.

Long Term:
	 - Figure out how to reconstruct the season timing data
	 - Think about how to combine data from multiple levels - how do we map daily data from a single point to a single yield number for a county.



26 Jan 2017
---------

Short Term:

	- Get crop data from USDA API
	  - There is existing code on github that might need to be modified to work.
	  - Focus on CA rice, from 1992 - 2016

	- Investigate DVD data
	  - Read the README file to see what is available
	  - Flag the most promising parameters
	  - (Data available on Duncan's server - see slack channel for link)

	- Pull solar radiation/weather data from CIMIS API
	  - Pull just a single station at first (Colusa)
	  -

Long Term:

	 - Explore above data (once collected) look for missing data, patterns, possible new areas of exploration.
	 - Conduct quality checks on the data.
	 - Code review. Make sure code from above steps is
	   1. Clear
	   2. Consistent
	   3. Robust




17 Jan, 2017
----------

  - Determine what data we need:
  	- See outline - Add more if you see anything missing

  - Where do those data live?
  	- Crop (USDA)
	- Solar radiation (NASA POWER, CIMIS, maybe PGE?)
	- Air Quality (CA Air Resource Board, weater.com?)
	- Covariates: climate, etc?

  - sign up for slack
  - Send Matt github usenames
  - Think about how to organize this
  	- How should we share data?
	-
