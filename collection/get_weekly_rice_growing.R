### code for extracting USDA data related to percentage of rice growing at any given time
### code structure from Matt Espe Apr 2015
### code by Henry Kvinge February 2007 modeled closely on code by Melissa Kardish January 2017

### This code is written to extract data from the USDA API.
### We are aiming to extract data from the database to 
### understand when rice crops were growing in California during a given year. 
### We want to eventually be able to compare this to solar radiation
### This code requires an API key that can be acquired from
### https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api and used as usda.api.key in the get_USDA_data function
### On 2/8/17 This extracts percentage rice emerged and percentage harvested (both weekly) 
### in California for each year specified. The output is a dataframe which has the year, the week
### number, the percentage of crop emerged, the percentage of crop harvested, and the percentage
### of the crop currently growing.
