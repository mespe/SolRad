We went through PM25 and PM10 files and found the following results.

PM25:

- They have (every 6 day) data starting from 1998 to 2014
- They have hourly data starting from 2012 to 2014
- They have data only for one Site in Colusa County

PM10:

- They have (every 6 day) data starting from 1998 to 2014 only one Colusa Site
- They have hourly data starting from 2013 to 2014 (NO data for Colusa Sites)

Although in the “Location.xlsx” file Colusa has 6 Sites, only 3 of them collected data. The rest did not have any ozone, pm25, or pm10 data.
